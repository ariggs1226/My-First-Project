        <form action="">
            <!-- Form input elements need to go here -->
            <!-- Inputs are where you INPUT info, like first and last name, phone number, 
            birth date, etc.-->
            <input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Email">
            <input type="number" name="zipCode" placeholder="ZipCode">
            <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone">
            <!--Notice the attributes and placeholders associated with each input. These 
            are important!
                Placeholders give users info as to what that input elements needs(or expects)
            Without placeholders, you may try to put in a phone number in a input that is 
            expecting a name, which wouldn't be good!
                Type attributes tell the browser how to handle that information. Should that
            input accept text or numeric values? On mobile devices, this may even change which
            on-screen keyboard is presented to the user.
                The name attribute keeps track of what information is captured in your form when
            you submit it.
                So, keep the context of the inputs within your form in mind when you are creating
            it.-->  

            <!--You can also create checkboxes and radio inputs in default HTML.-->
            <!--For example, a checkbox would look something like this:-->
            <input type="checkbox" name="chk1"> Option 1 is a square checkbox.
            <input type="checkbox" name="chk1"> Option 2 is also a square checkbox.
            <!--This would allow you to select as many of these options as you want. You just 
            need to change the type of the input to the checkbox, and you need some text associated
            with each input.-->
            <!--For radio inputs, you can only select ONE of the options available in one radio 
            group. This means you MUST HAVE the same name attribute in the radio input selections-->
            <input type="radio" name="radio-group"> Option 3 is a round checkbox.
            <input type="radio" name="radio-group"> Option 4 is also a round checkbox.
