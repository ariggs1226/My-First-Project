        <!--We're starting out with the basic structure of what 
        had in the previous section. We'll add our typography to 
        the article section in this HTML document. -->
        <article>My article text</article>
        <section>
            <div>Other content</div>

    HTML has some elements that we can use to demonstrate the 
importance of text in our document, and these elements also have
some default styling associated with them. These elements are 
called header elements. 
Here's an example: <!-- 
<article>
    <h1>Header 1</h1>
    <h2>Header 2</h2>
</article> -->
    Now, it's often not that useful to use all of the header 
elements at the same time. We usually only use the one that is 
appropriate for what we're trying to do. Let's say we have a blog
post that we want to create within this article. We may need ONE 
header and then we may want to use a paragraph element (p) for the 
content of the post. 
What would that look like? <!--
<article>
    <h3>This is a blog post!</h3>
    <p>This will show up as the text for my blog post. It will be 
        styled, by default, to be a normal font size, which makes 
        it good "reading" text -- the kind that you might find in
        a paragraph in a book.</p>
    <p>You can use paragraph elements as much as you need, and 
        sometimes you may want to style the text within an element.
        You can do that by using a <span> element</p>
    <p>It's easiest to think about "highlighting" text with a <span>
        <span style="background-color:yellow;"> If you wanted just
        this text to be yellow, you could use a span to do that!
    </span></p>
</article> -->
    Span is an inline-element. This means that it only takes up the 
space necessary for that element, instead of a block-element that 
takes up the full width of the window. This is why we can use it 
within the paragraph elements, and why it doesn't "break" the flow 
of the content in the document.
    There are other useful that add structure to our typography and 
the flow of our HTML doc. A big one is LISTS, and there and two kinds:
ordered lists (ol) and unordered lists (ul).
Example: <!--
    <article>
    <h3>This is a blog post!</h3>
    <p>This will show as the text for the blog post. It will be styled,
        by default, to be a normal font size, which makes it good 
        "reading" text -- the kind that you might find in a paragraph
        in a book.</p>
    <p>You can use paragraph elements as much as you need, and sometimes
        you may want to style the text within an element. You can do 
        that by using a <span> element. </p>
    <p>It's easiest to think about "highlighting" text with a span. 
        <span style="background-color:yellow;">If you wanted just 
        this text to be yellow, you could use a span to do that!</span>
    </p>
    <p>Now, let's say we want to add a list of things to do or 
        instructions on how to do something in this blog post. We 
        could add an unordered list for out to-do list, and we could 
        add an ordered lists for our instructions. Let's try it.</p>
    <h3>My To-Do List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Test out the Typography and Flow of HTML elements</li>
        <li>Take a nap></li>
        <li>Keep coding!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The First 3 Steps to Troublshoot Any Tech Issues</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn off the device.</li>
        <li>Turn the device back on.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2.</li>
    </ol>

    Of course, when you're browsing the internet, you often want
to link to other websites, images, etc. -or want other people to 
link to your site!
You can add links to your page by using anchor tags with the 
attribute href="/your/link/goes/here". 
An Example: <!--
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Click here to go to Google</a>
    <h3>My To-Do List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Test out the Typography and Flow of HTML elements</li>
        <li>Take a nap</li>
        <li>Keep coding!</li>
        <li><a href="https://covalence.io/" target="_blank" 
       rel="noopener noreferrer">You can also add hyperlinks inside 
       of other elements! Like this. Since we used the "target" 
       attribute with the value "_blank", the website will open in a 
       new tab or window. Rememberto use the "rel" attribute as well 
       for security concerns!</a></li>
    </ul> -->
